### Built with

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - CSS in JS library

### What I learned

This project was fun. I learned a lot about custom range input and how to customize them using vendor prefixes. I also learned a lot about react state management and hooks.

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to working with these technologies. One thing I want to do is to make progress bar of range input working for Chrome as it dose not have any vendor prefixes to do it.
